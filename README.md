# Khadka CMS

A **basic, self-use Content Management System (CMS)** built with **Flask + SQLite** to manage a personal portfolio / landing page.

This project was created for **personal use only** — it is intentionally simple, lightweight, and easy to extend when the landing page grows.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

- **Not a SaaS**
- **Not multi-user**

This CMS is meant to:
- Edit a personal website fast
- Be readable and hackable
- Scale *only when needed*

If the landing page grows, you add new sections **manually and cleanly**.
